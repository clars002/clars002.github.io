Hi there!
I'm Caelan, a computer science student at Old Dominion University. I graduated with my bachelor's in CS (with a minor in cybersecurity) in Fall 2024, and am currently working on my master's degree (also in CS).

I am broadly interested in software development. I am also making an effort to equip myself with a foundational knowledge of AI, since I figure its relevance will only increase into the future. However, I believe in the importance of depth of understanding, and for that reason make a point not to lean on AI too heavily in my regular workflow.

I am currently in the middle of switching from VSCode to Neovim. Putting aside the question of how much raw productivity I might gain in the long run from this, the software and the workflow it enables just appeals to me.
Also, I have been enjoying learning game development (with the Godot Engine, for now) on the side here and there.
I recently installed Arch Linux on my desktop machine for the first time, using nothing but the Arch wiki as a guide. I'm looking forward to becoming more proficient with Linux using this installation.

Outside of my studies, I like to spend time practicing Chinese martial arts with my dad, learning the violin, and playing (mostly old) video games. I am especially into Super Smash Bros. Melee, thanks to Project Slippi (My peak rank is gold 1).

Thank you for your time and interest!
